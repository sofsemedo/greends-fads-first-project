5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?

cp is the command used to copy files
../temp-* specifies the source files
. specifies de destination which is the current directory we are in.
It copies any files that start with "temp-" from the parent directory into the greends-fads-first-project


5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?

when cloning a repository it automatically sets up a .git directory in the cloned folder. For this reason there is no need to run git init.



5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.
